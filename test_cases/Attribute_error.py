# Define a variable 'x' as a list instead of an integer
x = [1, 2, 3]  # Initialize x as a list

# Now you can use the append method
x.append(10)  # Append the number 10 to the list x

# Print the list to show that 10 has been added
print(x)

# def modify_x(x):
#     print(x)
#     x = x + 2
#     return x

# x = modify_x(x)
